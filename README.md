## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned a trick to centre a block in the body and also the creation of space between the lines.

```css
body {
    display: grid;
    place-content: center;
    height: 100vh;
}
.card__content {
    line-height: 1.7rem;
}
```
### Continued development

Learn and practice more about CSS animations.
